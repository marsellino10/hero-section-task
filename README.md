# âš¡ Hero Section Component

A simple, responsive Hero Section built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. Includes dynamic content switching with a "Regenerate with AI" button.

## ðŸ“– About the Project

This project features a reusable Hero Section component that showcases a headline, subheadline, image, and call-to-action button. It simulates AI-generated content updates by rotating between pre-defined dummy data, making it suitable for landing pages or marketing sites.

### Key Features:
- Displays dynamic content (title, subtitle, image, and CTA)
- "Regenerate with AI" button updates the content instantly
- Responsive and modern design
- Local asset support for faster image loading

I built this project to demonstrate front-end skills using modern tooling, component-based architecture, and good UX principles. Dummy content and images were customized to reflect real-world topics like football, food delivery, and e-commerce.
